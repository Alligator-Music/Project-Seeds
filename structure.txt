seeds is a kernel with a simple cli and custom file system

loading structure (what happens when u start the computer):
    MBR - this is loaded by the bios bla bla bla and then loads the seeds loader.
        for more information on this, go look at the source code!!!
    
    seeds loader or load.bin - loads the operating system and enters protected mode.
    
    general kernel stuff:
        so after load.bin loads the kernel, it initializes some drivers and then shows
        a 'boot menu' which has some options to boot into, right now there is only the option to
        boot into the Seeds CLI (Command Line Interface).

    CLI:
        this is just a command line interface... nothing else to see here

how the disk is setup:
    for a seedfs disk its setup like this:
        MBR (1 sect) + RESERVED (16 sect) + FILETABLE (32 sect) + ... (all files)

        in this case, the os is setup like this:
            MBR (1 sect) + load.bin (16 sect) + filetable (32 sect) + kernel (32 sect) + ... (programs and stuff)
